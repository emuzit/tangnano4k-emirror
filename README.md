## Project tangnano4k-emirror

This project generates zero-delay 720p60 mirrored video display with Sipeed Tang Nano 4K FPGA board and OmniVision OV5640 image sensor. By adjusting DVP timing of OV5640 to VESA compatible frame format, DVP frames can be fed directly to DVI_TX module without frame buffering to achieve zero delay display.
